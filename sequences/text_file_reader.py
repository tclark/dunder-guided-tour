# This one is a bit more challenging. Write a class that reads
# lines from a text file, but do not use readlines or anything
# like that that stores all the lines in a list. You might
# want to read large files. Implement your class as an Immutable 
# Sequence so that, for example, file[104] gives you the 104th 
# line in the file
